It is larger than the Great Wall of China and the only living thing on earth visible from space. It is home to 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of corals, 130 species of sharks, rays, and a massive variety of other sea life. The marine park protects a large part of the reef from any negative impact of human use such as fishing and tourism. Unfortunately, the reef is facing one the primary threats to its system's health, that is the overpopulation of the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). This is a large starfish that preys upon hard, or stony coral polyps and it is one of the largest starfish in the world. An outbreak of these starfish can devastate reefs as they contribute to a loss of live coral cover. The outbreak is believed to occur in natural cycles, worsened by poor water quality and overfishing of the starfish's predators.\n\n<iframe width=\"682\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UT2noVDFoaA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIn order to control COTS outbreaks to ecologically sustainable levels, The Great Barrier Reef Foundation established an innovation program  in which AI technology could improve image detection underwater which is the main goal of this competition, that is, to accurately identify starfish in real-time by building an object detection model trained on underwater videos of coral reefs.\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"e09c136c-2622-4065-b48a-da2568d03657","tags":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Training YOLO Object Detection on a Kaggle Dataset**\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThis notebook walks through how to train a YOLO object detection model using the TensorFlow Object Detection API.\nIn this specific example, we'll be training an object detection model to accurately identify starfish in real-time, trained on underwater videos of coral reefs. \nEverything in this notebook is also hosted on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/arnold402/in2deep). Our final submission is located on the main branch, while additional work is avaliable in the [development branch](https://github.com/arnold402/in2deep/tree/development).

Our dataset consists of the following:\n\n#### Files\n\n**train/** - Folder containing training set photos of the form **video_{video_id}/{video_frame_number}.jpg**.\n\n**[train/test].csv** - Metadata for the images. As with other test files, most of the test metadata data is only available to your notebook upon submission. Just the first few rows available for download.\n\n* `video_id` - ID number of the video the image was part of. The video ids are not meaningfully ordered.\n\n* `video_frame` - The frame number of the image within the video. Expect to see occasional gaps in the frame number from when the diver surfaced.\n\n* `sequence` - ID of a gap-free subset of a given video. The sequence ids are not meaningfully ordered.\n\n* `sequence_frame` - The frame number within a given sequence.\n\n* `image_id` - ID code for the image, in the format '__{video_id}-{video_frame}__'\n\n* `annotations` - The bounding boxes of any starfish detections in a string format that can be evaluated directly with Python. Does not use the same format as the predictions you will submit. Not available in `test.csv`. A bounding box is described by the pixel coordinate (x_min, y_min) of its upper left corner within the image together with its width and height in pixels.\n\n**example_sample_submission.csv** - A sample submission file in the correct format. The actual sample submission will be provided by the API; this is only provided to illustrate how to properly format predictions. The submission format is further described on the Evaluation page.\n\n**example_test.npy** - Sample data that will be served by the example API.\n\n**greatbarrierreef** - The image delivery API that will serve the test set pixel arrays. You may need Python 3.7 and a Linux environment to run the example offline without errors.\n\n#### Time-series API Details\n\nThe API serves the images one by one, in order by video and frame number, as pixel arrays.\nExpect to see roughly 13,000 images in the test set.\nThe API will require roughly two GB of memory after initialization. The initialization step (env.iter_test()) will require meaningfully more memory than that; we recommend you do not load your model until after making that call. The API will also consume less than ten minutes of runtime for loading and serving the data. \n\nThe dataset can be found at Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef/data).\n\n\n### **Our Model**\n\nWe'll be training a YOLO neural network. For YOLO, detection is a simple regression problem which takes an input image and learns the class probabilities and bounding\nbox coordinates. Sounds simple? YOLO divides each image into a grid of S x S and each grid predicts N bounding boxes and confidence. The confidence reflects the\naccuracy of the bounding box and whether the bounding box actually contains an object(regardless of class). YOLO also predicts the classification score for each box for\nevery class in training. You can combine both the classes to calculate the probability of each class being present in a predicted box. (Consider [this](https://neptune.ai/blog/object-detection-with-yolo-hands-on-tutorial) deep dive for more!)\n\n#### YOLO compared to other detectors\n\nAlthough a convolutional neural net (CNN) is used under the hood of YOLO, it’s still able to detect objects with real-time performance. It’s possible thanks to YOLO’s ability to do the predictions simultaneously in a single-stage approach. Other, slower algorithms for object detection (like Faster R-CNN) typically use a two-stage approach:\n\n* in the first stage, interesting image regions are selected. These are the parts of an image that might contain any objects\n\n* in the second stage, each of these regions is classified using a convolutional neural net. \n\nUsually, there are many regions on an image with the objects. All of these regions are sent to classification. Classification is a time-consuming operation, which is why the two-stage object detection approach performs slower compared to one-stage detection.YOLO doesn’t select the interesting parts of an image, there’s no need for that. Instead, it predicts bounding boxes and classes for the whole image in a single forward net pass.\n\nYolo does not face many of the limitations faced by other object detection algorithms such high computational times faced by CNN or Fast-RCNN models.\n\n### **Training**\n\nGoogle Colab provides free GPU resources. Click \"Runtime\" → \"Change runtime type\" → Hardware Accelerator dropdown to \"GPU.\"\nColab does have memory limitations, and notebooks must be open in your browser to run. Sessions automatically clear themselves after 12 hours.\n\n### **Inference**\n\nWe'll run inference directly in this notebook, and on test images contained in the \"test\" folder from kaggle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"05fe3b36-fc3a-4bc8-9673-b5daeefb739a","tags":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Install required packages","metadata":{"cell_id":"2595bf98-d6b2-41a4-9d73-16276510d720","tags":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# norfair dependencies\n%cd /kaggle/input/norfair031py3/\n!pip install commonmark-0.9.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl -f ./ --no-index\n!pip install rich-9.13.0-py3-none-any.whl\n!mkdir /kaggle/working/tmp\n!cp -r /kaggle/input/norfair031py3/filterpy-1.4.5/filterpy-1.4.5/ /kaggle/working/tmp/\n%cd /kaggle/working/tmp/filterpy-1.4.5/\n!pip install .\n!rm -rf /kaggle/working/tmp\n\n# norfair\n%cd /kaggle/input/norfair031py3/\n!pip install norfair-0.3.1-py3-none-any.whl -f ./ --no-index\n%cd ..","metadata":{"cell_id":"a8dadca9-3464-4b00-b6ab-c0b869591efa","deepnote_cell_type":"code","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-09T11:31:42.192049Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-09T11:31:42.192698Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-09T11:32:57.686114Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-09T11:31:42.192604Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-09T11:32:57.685247Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import Libraries","metadata":{"cell_id":"00001-0d3ef0a6-799c-43e0-83c3-860050226d1d","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\ntqdm.pandas()\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport glob\nimport shutil\nimport sys\nimport time\nsys.path.append('../input/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef')\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw\nimport ast\nimport albumentations as albu\nimport random","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","cell_id":"00002-3b2f10e0-2659-4526-9e7e-4a009007a6ac","deepnote_cell_type":"code","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-09T11:32:57.688031Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-09T11:32:57.688347Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-09T11:33:01.403951Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-09T11:32:57.688304Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-09T11:33:01.403193Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Path to root directory\nROOT_DIR  = '/kaggle/input/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef/'","metadata":{"cell_id":"00003-5b98d187-da5c-42fd-9959-adc76f194b46","deepnote_cell_type":"code","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-09T11:33:01.405525Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-09T11:33:01.405797Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-09T11:33:01.409341Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-09T11:33:01.405761Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-09T11:33:01.408673Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Increase Annotations\n\n**Hypothesis:** we can enlarge our training data set by adding earlier bounding boxes prior to the first detected box for each COTS.\n\nAn increase in annotations means increase in training data which hypothetically can increase accuracy.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1.
